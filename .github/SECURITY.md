# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🛡️ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The security of Keypress Notifications is a top priority. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### 📧 Private Disclosure

**Please do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security issues privately to:
- **Email**: [vijayanand431@gmail.com](mailto:vijayanand431@gmail.com)
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Keypress Notifications - [Brief Description]`

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Environment**: VS Code version, OS, Node.js version
5. **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept (if safe)
6. **Severity**: Your assessment of the vulnerability severity

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (1-4 weeks)
- **Release**: Coordinated disclosure after fix

## 🔍 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

| 0.x.x   | ❌ No             |

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### 🏗️ Development Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security issues
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular security updates via Renovate
- **Audit Pipeline**: npm audit in CI/CD pipeline

### 🔒 Runtime Security

- **No Network Requests**: Extension operates entirely offline
- **Local Data Only**: No external data transmission
- **VS Code API Only**: Uses only official VS Code APIs
- **No Shell Execution**: No system command execution
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized

### 📦 Distribution Security

- **Official Marketplace**: Distributed only through official VS Code Marketplace
- **Signed Releases**: All releases are signed and verified
- **Reproducible Builds**: Build process is transparent and reproducible
- **Source Code**: Fully open source for security review

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Potential Risk Areas

1. **Command Interception**: Extension intercepts VS Code commands
   - **Mitigation**: Only monitors common multi-key commands
   - **Scope**: Limited to built-in VS Code operations (clipboard, navigation, file ops)

2. **Configuration Storage**: Extension stores user preferences
   - **Mitigation**: Uses VS Code's secure configuration system
   - **Scope**: Only extension settings, no sensitive data

3. **Logging**: Extension may log basic debugging information
   - **Mitigation**: No sensitive data logged, basic operation info only
   - **Scope**: Local VS Code output channel only

### ✅ Security Features

- **No External Dependencies**: Minimal attack surface
- **No Data Collection**: Zero telemetry or data collection
- **Sandboxed Environment**: Runs in VS Code's extension sandbox
- **Permission Model**: Limited to required VS Code APIs only

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Users

### 💡 Recommendations

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Official Source**: Install only from VS Code Marketplace
3. **Review Permissions**: Check extension permissions before installing
4. **Monitor Activity**: Review VS Code output channel if concerned
5. **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious behavior immediately

### 🚫 What We Don't Do

- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect any user data
- **No Network Access**: No external network requests
- **No File System Access**: Only VS Code workspace interaction
- **No System Calls**: No direct operating system access
- **No Third-party Services**: No external service dependencies
