### 🎪 Enterprise-Grade Detection System

The extension uses **advanced command interception** to monitor VS Code's keybinding executions:

**🔍 Monitored Commands:**

- `editor.action.clipboardCutAction` (Ctrl+X) → We intercept this! ✂️
- `editor.action.clipboardCopyAction` (Ctrl+C) → We intercept this! 📄  
- `editor.action.clipboardPasteAction` (Ctrl+V) → We intercept this! 📋
- `workbench.action.files.saveAll` (Ctrl+K S) → We intercept this! 💾
- `workbench.action.showCommands` (Ctrl+Shift+P) → We intercept this! 🎯
- **70+ Multi-key combinations** with intelligent filtering! ⚡

**🏗️ Enterprise Detection Process:**

1. **🎯 Command Interception**: Register interceptors for multi-key commands
2. **📖 Keybinding Analysis**: Parse VS Code keybinding configuration in real-time
3. **🔍 Intelligent Filtering**: Apply minimum key requirements and exclusion rules  
4. **🔔 Smart Notifications**: Display contextual notifications with command details
5. **⚡ Seamless Execution**: Execute original command without interruption
6. **🛡️ Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of edge cases and failures

**🎯 Advanced Features:**

- **Configurable minimum keys** (1-5) for noise reduction
- **Wildcard exclusions** for fine-grained control
- **Command name display** for learning and debugging
- **Cross-platform compatibility** with platform-specific key mappings
